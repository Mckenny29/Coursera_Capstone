Background\n\n\nThis IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone Project seeks to use Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithm to advice Skentelo on the best location for their new restaurant. In this project, I have usedon Foursquare location data to explore neighborhoods in Inner London.\n\n\n### 1.2. Problem\n\n\nI will explore the Boroughs in Inner London and answer the question: \u201cWhere is the appropriate place to open a new restaurant in Inner London?\u201d \n\n\n### 1.3. Interest\n\n\n London is one of the biggest international cities in the world, and one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world. Opening a restaurant there is a smart idea for anyone looking for a good flow of income. Identifying the popular locations in London will indicate the direction for the location of the restaurant and help Skentelo make an informed business decision.\n",

Data Sources\n\nMy main two data sources are:\n\n1.\tWikipedia[1] provides the list of Districts and Boroughs in Inner London\n2.\tVenues data from Foursquare[2]\n\n\n## 2.2. Data Cleaning\n\nLondon is divided into of Inner London and Outer London. My focus for this project is Inner London. Inner London has a total of 12 Boroughs.\nFirstly, I will be collecting data on the District and Boroughs from Wikipedia and find the coordinates for every Borough. This I have done manually and the data is in the table below.\n\n*table to be worked on later*\n\n*S/N\tDistrict\tBorough\tLat\tLon\n1\tInner\tGreenwich\t52.0367323\t1.168934\n2\tInner\tHackney\t51.5432402\t-0.0493621\n3\tInner\tHammersmith\t51.4920377\t-0.2236401\n4\tInner\tIslington\t51.5384287\t-0.0999051\n5\tInner\tKensington and Chelsea\t51.4875417\t-0.1682205\n6\tInner\tLambeth\t51.5013012\t-0.117287\n7\tInner\tLewisham\t51.4624325\t-0.0101331\n8\tInner\tSouthwark\t51.5029222\t-0.103458\n9\tInner\tTower Hamlets\t51.1288633\t1.2986686\n10\tInner\tWandsworth\t51.4570271\t-0.1932607\n11\tInner\tWestminster\t51.4973206\t-0.137149\n12\tInner\tCamden\t51.5517\t0.1588*\n\n\n## 2.3 Feature Selection\n\nFurther to the data on the Boroughs, I will obtain a data of recommended venues within 1000 meters radius of every Borough and determine the top 10 most common venues by its category as features. I will be employing Foursquare Location data for this purpose.\n",
